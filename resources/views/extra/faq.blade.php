                <h3>The CD key that I received doesn't work</h3>
                <div class="ig-wrapper2">
                    <p>If the received CD Key does not work, or if the code is hard to read, open a ticket in the

                    <p>No! No time limit, so you can use it whenever you want, or offer it to a party which will happen

                <h3>Are the keys valid in all countries?</h3>
                <div class="ig-wrapper2">
                    <p>No, publishers are subjected to a policy regulating the import / export of the games. The codes
                        are
                        sometimes subject to a national restriction, but this is not always the case. This information
                        is
                        visible on the page of each game before purchase.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Is a refund possible?</h3>
                <div class="ig-wrapper2">
                    <p>Considering the nature of the CD key we sell, a refund is possible, but a deadline of 10 days may
                        be
                        necessary for us to check if the code has not been used.<br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>How many times can I download a game?</h3>
                <div class="ig-wrapper2">
                    <p>It's unlimited. Once a CD key is recorded with a game on your account, you can re-download it as
                        many
                        times as you want. The activation will be immediate without the need to buy back a card, as long
                        as
                        you are registered with your account used to buy the CD key.</p>
